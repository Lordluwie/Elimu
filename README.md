# Elimu – Student Login UI

Elimu is a modern student login interface for a school portal. It features animated borders, a dark theme, and a clean, minimal form suitable for KCSE / secondary school systems.

## Features

- Animated, colorful border using CSS keyframes  
- Dark-themed login card with focus on readability  
- Responsive centered layout  
- Ready to connect to a dashboard (e.g. `dashboard.html`)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (animations, keyframes, box-shadow)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (for future login handling)

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder using a simple static server (VS Code Live Server, Python `http.server`, etc.).

You can update the form `action` or JS to connect this UI to a real backend or a student dashboard page.
